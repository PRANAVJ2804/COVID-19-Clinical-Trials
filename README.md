# 🌍 Global COVID-19 Clinical Trials Analysis 🧪

## Project Overview 📝
This project provides a comprehensive analysis and visualization of global COVID-19 clinical trials. The focus is on understanding trial statuses, phases, participant enrollments, geographic distribution, and timeline trends. The goal is to identify key patterns and insights to help researchers, policymakers, and healthcare professionals monitor the landscape of COVID-19 clinical research. 🌐💉

## Repository Contents 📂

  Detailed exploratory data analysis (EDA) report with background, data cleaning, and visual insights on the clinical trials dataset.
  
- **Python-and-Machine-Learning-File.ipynb** 👨‍💻  
  Jupyter Notebook implementing data cleaning, feature engineering, exploratory data analysis, and a supervised machine learning model (Random Forest) for predicting trial status.
  
- **Sql-Analysis-File.sql** 🗃️  
  SQL queries for summarizing and exploring COVID-19 clinical trials data, including counts by status, phases, countries, funding sources, and monthly trial starts.

- **Dashboard.jpg** 📊  
  Dashboard visualization capturing trial status distribution, enrollment by phases, country-wise trial counts, and trial timelines.

## Objective 🎯
To analyze and visualize the global landscape of COVID-19 clinical trials, focusing on:
- Trial status distributions and phases 📈
- Participant enrollment trends 👥
- Geographic spread of trials 🌎
- Timeline and trends of clinical trial initiation 📆

The dashboard and analyses facilitate identification of key trends and patterns in clinical research activity worldwide.

## Getting Started 🚀

### Prerequisites ✅
- Python 3.x 🐍
- Jupyter Notebook 📓
- Libraries: pandas, numpy, seaborn, matplotlib, scikit-learn, scipy 📚
- SQL Database (optional for running SQL queries on clinical trial data) 🗄️

### Installation 💻
1. Clone this repository:
    ```
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/covid19-clinical-trials-analysis.git
    ```
2. Navigate into the project directory:
    ```
    cd covid19-clinical-trials-analysis
    ```
3. (Optional) Create and activate a virtual environment:
    ```
    python -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate   # On Windows use: venv\Scripts\activate
    ```
4. Install required Python packages:
    ```
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```
5. Open and run the Jupyter notebook `Python-and-Machine-Learning-File.ipynb` to execute the data analysis and model training steps. 🏃‍♂️

6. Use the SQL file `Sql-Analysis-File.sql` to run queries on your clinical trials database if desired. 🗃️

## Usage 📌
- Review the EDA report PDF for detailed analysis background and data insights. 📄
- Execute the notebook to reproduce the exploratory data analysis, cleaning steps, feature engineering, and model evaluation. 👨‍💻
- Use the SQL queries to perform additional database exploration and reports. 🛠️
- View the dashboard image for a summarized visual overview of trial distributions and trends. 📊

## Results 📊
- The Random Forest model achieved ~56% accuracy predicting trial status. 🏆
- Key findings include high recruitment activity, varied enrollment sizes by phase, and concentrated trial activity across major countries. 🌍
- A timeline spike in trials started during pandemic peaks highlights global research responsiveness. 📅
